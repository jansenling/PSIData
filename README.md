PSIData
=======
This is a simple Shiny app for reading a dataset (csv form) of Pollution Standard Index (PSI) across 
5 regions (N, S, E, W and Central) over a 24-hour period.
The application will first import the sample csv (24-HR PSI.csv) and display a table of the dataset on the first tab "Table"
The second tab "Plot" plots of the PSI values and the corresponding frequency of occurences.
The last tab "Summary" provide the means, meadian, min, max and quartile values.
The files needed to run this app are:
a. ui.R
b. server.R and
c. 24-HR PSI.csv (the sample dataset to input after the app is launch)

Do provide me any inputs as I'm new to programming.
Thanks in advance
