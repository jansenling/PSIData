PSIData
=======
This is a simple Shiny app for reading a dataset (csv form) of Pollution Standard Index (PSI) across 
5 regions (N, S, E, W and Central) over a 24-hour period.
The application will first import the sample csv (24-HR PSI.csv) 
[Table] tab -- display a table of the dataset 
[Plot] tab -- plots of the PSI values and the corresponding frequency of occurences.
[Summary] tab --  provide the means, meadian, min, max and quartile values.

The files needed to run this app are:
a. ui.R
b. server.R and
c. 24-HR PSI.csv (the sample dataset to input after the app is launch)

If you want to test my published app, please checkout the following URL for my shiny app is: https://dreamz.shinyapps.io/PSIData/
but remember to download the (c) the sample 24-HR PSI.csv dataset.  Have fun!

Do provide me any inputs as I'm new to programming.
Thanks in advance
